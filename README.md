# Process-Light-Fields-Captured-with-Lytro-Camera-via-Light-Field-Toolbox-for-MATLAB
This repository contains the source code and materials for processing light fields captured with a Lytro Camera, the [Light Field Toolbox for MATLAB](https://dgd.vision/Tools/LFToolbox/) (*with [license](LFToolbox0.5/LICENSE.txt)*) is implemented in order to obtain the sub-aperture images, the angular matrix at some fixed spatial point or all spatial points.

Moreover, this repository only contains two captured light fields as examples, the full dataset is avalible at [asdasd](asdasd) [1].
